wavegeometry_model/README

This repository contains a Python translation of the wavegeometry model by Nili Harnik and collegues.

    basicstate.py Translates bscomp.f
    anywave.py Translates a2comp.f
    
run/
     pre-process.ipynb Notebook to compute and store basicstate from eraint netCDF files. Importantly, it makes us Grid class and user-level function interp2z, pv_gradient, and bouancy_frequency.
     run.ipynb Notebook to solve the model. That involves loading the basic state, defining the sponge, the lower boundary condition & matrix equation, and plotting diagnostics.
     debug.ipynb Notebook to run the model from a very smooth basic state.
     
input/
    small namelist files
